- install.py should compile the binaries to the bin/ and then install them
- use systemd/Timers to setup an automated backup mechanism for firefox:
    - https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1121064
- add the installation guide here
- create basic post-installation package_sync files for different targets:
    - virtual (headless)
    - virtual (with X11)
    - full (with X11)
- switch to QEMU from VBox, create different targets:
    - headless Arch (master, work)
    - Arch with X11 (test)
    - Windows
    - macOS
- setup taskwarrior properly with automated sync
- decide what to do with the vms backup mechanims (in case of doing so, add the
  following line to the backup.service ([Service] can have multiple ExecStart):
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/duplicity incremental --no-encryption --name='vms_backup' --verbosity=4 --volsize=256 --compare-data --tempdir='/tmp' --archive-dir='/tmp' --exclude='/vms/lost+found' /vms file:///backup/vms)
- make naming consistent: mobile => notebook
- package_sync check if commands succeded or not
- rename package_sync to system_sync (it can run arbitrary commands)
- create a script to update plank dconf settings
- find out why the enabled and working systemd-timer (backup) is removed after reboot
