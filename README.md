dotfiles
========

Configuration, automation and data files to make my Arch Linux distro feel like
home wherever I use it, after all, I spend a decent amount of time of my life
 working with it, so it was a natural desire not to fight against it.

*Be warned though, these settings may perfectly suit my needs, but that does
not mean they will do yours. Therefore do not use entire files nor copy/paste
lines from them unless you truly understand what you are doing!*

Other than that, use it well! :smile:
