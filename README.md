dotfiles
========

Configurations, automations, binaries, and data files which are making my Arch
Linux installations feel like home every time I'm sitting in front of them.

*Be warned though, these settings may perfectly suit my needs, but that does
not mean they will do the same for yours.  Therefore do not use entire files nor
copy/paste lines blindly from them unless you truly understand what you are
doing!*

Use it well! :smile:
